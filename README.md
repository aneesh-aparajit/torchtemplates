# Torch Templates

- The file structure is vastly inspired from [madewithml.com](https://madewithml.com/) and many Kaggle Kernels from top kagglers.

- Till now, this would create a package for you with the `setup.py` and the `requirements.txt`.
- TODO:
    - Add jinja templates for the `dataloaders`, `training loops` and the `models`.
